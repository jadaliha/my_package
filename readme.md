# Python - Packages
We organize a large number of files in different folders and subfolders based on some criteria, so that we can find and manage them easily. In the same way, a package in Python takes the concept of the modular approach to next logical level. As you know, a module can contain multiple objects, such as classes, functions, etc. A package can contain one or more relevant modules. Physically, a package is actually a folder containing one or more module files.
